# Mazer
Created the week of April 28th, 2014 as my first attempt at an Android app. Reused some of the code already in [RandomMazeGenerator](../../../RandomMazeGenerator) to make the solvable mazes.

Essentially an endurance game, Mazer comes with three levels of difficulty: Mazes of width 3, 4, or 5 blocks. Once a difficulty has been selected, the user holds down on their phone and a completely randomly generated maze begins to fall down from the top of the screen. The player now must swype through the entanglement of lines, careful not to hit the edges of the ever increasing descent of the maze. Personal high scores are recorded and announced as the player beats their old records.

You can try out the game for yourself [here!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ryan.mazer&hl=en)

This game is currently in the process of being completely rewritten. **Caution:** As this was my first attempt at an Android app, the code found here may be a bit rough and poorly documented. Ye be warned.
